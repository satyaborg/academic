👋🏼 Hi there wanderer\
\
I am deeply passionate about programming, building things and always up for exchanging ideas and indulging in a few thought bubbles. Artificial intelligence fascinates me: the unexplored recesses of human creativity, the augmentation of our collective intelligence, a universal problem solver in some sense and its implications (ethical or otherwise). The road is long and winding, but I hope it will provide a window into understanding our own cognition along the way.\
\
To that end, I work with machine/deep learning paradigms and am currently a Research Fellow at [Monash University](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/satya-borgohain). In terms of research, I work in the areas of Interpretable/Explainable AI, Natural Language Processing, Bio-plausible AI, Sparsity, Bayesian Neural Networks among others. I studied Mechanical Engineering and subsequently Data Science for my Bachelors and Masters respectively. In my prior life, I built and shipped predictive models to production.\
\
In my spare time, you might find me playing the guitar, video games, listening to a plethora of music, reading or occasionally most likely [sketching](https://www.satyaborg.com/artworks). I also love hiking and exploring nature in general which is something I wish I have more time for in the future!\

If you would like to chat or collaborate please feel free to [shoot me an email](mailto:satya.borg@gmail.com). Where there are synergies, creativity oft follows.
